Here you will find a small paragraph welcoming the user to the site, and explaing in short text what the site has to offer. Along with a facts on the left side, links to other portions of the site, images of two skeins of yarn and a crochet snake, crochet snake image has a link that send you to a website (that is not mine of course) that shows you how to make the snake, and the footer that has the "About Us" section and copyright.
